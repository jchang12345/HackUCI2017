# War
Quick and easy war card game, followed a swift tutorial on how to create this. Used basic swift programming logic, a lot of work on the front end
portion with delgating view controlls, setting up the assets, icons, and finally getting the app to upload onto an iOS device with many updates. 
Fun experience, done with Andy Duong at UCI Hacks as a practice tutorial project. Below is a link to the youtube demo of this game.
